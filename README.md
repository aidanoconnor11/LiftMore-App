# LiftMore-App
Copying over the files didn't go as planned and I had to manually copy them so certain directory structure wasn't maintained. Apologies for that! Still you can get an idea for how I went about making this application. 

Also, the backend for the application is no longer deployed since the service it was using became a paid subscription. So the application can no longer be used on the internet :(
